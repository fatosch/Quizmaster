Simple Singlescreen-App made for Android EU Scholarship on Udacity.com 
This App is made to show my recently learned skills. It is a single-screen quiz-app about mathematics which contains 5 questions. 
The task was to create a quiz which uses specific views to validate the answers. The views I have used here are: EditText, RadioGroup and CheckBox.
In the nearest future I'm planing to add a german translation since it is the language I use to communicate everyday.
